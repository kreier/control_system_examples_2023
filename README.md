# Examples of Control Systems

These are the files we used in class with the Sphero RVR for control and API

## Examples to use Feedback control Loops

1. on/off control
2. on/off control with tolerance
3. proportional control
4. proportional-integral control
5. proportional-integral-derivative control, see [PID controller on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller)
